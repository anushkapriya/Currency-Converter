# Currency-Converter
I created a currency converter using Tkinter (A Python GUI module).
This GUI-based Currency Converter accepts the Indian rupee as input value and converts that value to US Dollar, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, British Pound, Chinese Yuan, etc. when the user clicks the covert button.
